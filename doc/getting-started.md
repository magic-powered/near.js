# Getting started

## Installation 

```shell
npm i near.js --save
```

```shell
yarn add near.js
```

## Packages

Near.js is a set of independent modules that can be used without installing the whole library.

Each module is available as a separate package under @naer.js namespace:

```shell
npm i @near.js/provider-rpc --save
```

```shell
yarn add @near.js/provider-rpc
```

The modular structure allows developers to be more granular building their app. 
Ensure their microservices and micro frontends fetch only essential Near modules.
